## About 
Recently graduated Front-end developer from Noroff school of technology and digital media. Proficient in web-languages, SEO, as well as accessability principles and solutions. 

I believe UX should be in the forefront of all app development, and that the best user experiences are those that require the least amount of effort to interact with. Only show what the user need to see, only tell what the user needs to know.
